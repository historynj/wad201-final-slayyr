# Final Project

**Objective:**

The objective would be to create a website using either of the Figma mockups. There are 2 options for you to choose from, below are 2 figma links, as a group you are to select <u>only one</u> project from below: 

* [Digitec Portfolio](https://www.figma.com/design/an79ptSFkhjtHCEOkFtETA/DIGITEC-Portfolio-REDO-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=0xVoBXgN1jU0yxBb-1)
* [Carla Beauty Clone](https://www.figma.com/design/I3K8s3cWFBYjMaKcyXn4En/BC-Beauty---WMAD%2BUI%2FUXDesign-(1st-Version)---WINNER-(Copy)?node-id=4106-556&t=7juvIi5OCzBXHqlT-1)

This exercise will help to sharpen your HTML, CSS and JS further and also increase your soft skills working as a team.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **HTML, CSS, and JS:** 60% (code quality of final work, clear indication of work done, responsiveness, resemblance of the mockup)
- **Teamwork:** 40% (attending classes, usage of GitHub, maintaining consistency, presentation)

## Project Details

- For this task, you will convert the figma design to a fully functional website.
- Discuss how to divide the work between team members. Clearly indicate who is working on what and stick to it. Use **Github Projects** to manage these tasks. (Make sure to add me to your GitHub Project)
- Use Git for version control. Donâ€™t forget to commit often. Create protection rules for the main branch. **No push into main**. (I will lock the `main` branch)
- Use HTML and CSS (SCSS) (optionally Astro or Bootstrap) and JS to develop your website.
- If there are `Forms` in your project, you can use [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/) to send the data over to a specified email address. 
- Deploy your website using any hosting providers of your choice (BIG BONUS)
- Setup CI/CD for the main branch (BIG BONUS)
